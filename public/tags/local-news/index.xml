      <description>The University of Exeter has green-lit the building of a new Multi-Faith Centre behind the Forum building. Replacing the existing Muslim prayer rooms and multi-faith spaces in the Old Library.
The new building will be located in the green area behind the Forum Kitchen, and down the steps from the Starbucks outside seating area.
The University has said that it will pursue building the Centre according to sustainable practices whilst aiming to reduce carbon emissions during the process.</description>
