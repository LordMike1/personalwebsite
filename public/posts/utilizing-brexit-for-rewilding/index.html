  <div class="pb-4"></div>
  <p>Before Brexit, agriculture in the UK was subscribed to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which focused on ensuring “affordable, safe and high-quality food”, supporting farmers’ incomes, and protecting the environment (European Council, 2022). This policy was used as a catch-all system, ignoring the fact that certain areas might benefit from something more bespoke.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since about 2017, DEFRA, the government department responsible for all things relating to the environment, food production, and rural affairs, has been telling farmers to prepare for a change. The government has been wanting to take advantage of Brexit to phase out the EU’s CAP, and to implement their own system.</p>
<p>The Environmental Land-Management Scheme (ELMs), in theory, changes how farmers are subsidised for protecting the environment and farming responsibly, not overusing chemicals, preventing soil erosion, and the like (Barkham &amp; Horton, 2022). The UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outline some of the biggest problems currently facing the world’s development. Despite ELMs being critiqued by some and praised by others, it’s a pretty substantial step towards preserving “life on land” (SDG 15).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The scheme works like this: a farmer fills out a form with the government which explains why, where, and how a specific project will benefit the environment. DEFRA then looks over this proposal and decides whether it’s good enough to sponsor. The farmer then discusses the project with DEFRA, and they agree on how much funding the government can provide – for projects under their “Landscape Recovery” category, the government can pay up to 100% of the costs (Parkinson &amp; Burford, 2022). Once this is all settled, the farmer enters into an agreement with the government to complete this project and carry it on for <em>at least</em> the next 20 years (Parkinson &amp; Burford, 2022).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even though the government calls it one scheme, there are actually 2 main parts of it (there used to be three, but the government changed its mind at the start of December (Coffey, 2022)). The sustainable-farming incentive aims to “encourage actions that improve soil health … recognise how moorland provides benefits … [help] farmers with the costs of veterinary [costs]” (DEFRA &amp; Rural Payments Agency, 2022). The other part of the scheme is called The Landscape Recovery scheme. It will try to preserve much larger swathes of countryside. It hopes to establish “new nature reserves, [restore] floodplains, [and] create woodland and wetlands” (DEFRA et al., 2022).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, the government has recently made a U-turn on the third part of ELMs. It was meant to be called the Local Nature Recovery scheme. It was meant to be a “more ambitious successor to the Countryside Stewardship scheme”, which already pays farmers to protect their land (Munroe, 2022; Rural Payments Agency, 2020). The Environment Secretary mentioned in a speech that the Local Nature Recovery scheme would be scrapped because it was too similar to the already operating Countryside Stewardship scheme (Coffey, 2022) . According to DEFRA themselves, the Local Nature Recovery scheme was meant to restore up to “10,000 hectares of wildlife habitat” (DEFRA et al., 2022).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As well as the promised improvements in wildlife habitats, the decision has sparked fears amongst farmers that it will result in the “retrofitting” of an old policy to (probably poorly) fit the new targets (Marshall, 2022). DEFRA did justify their decision to cancel this policy by saying that it will provide a smoother transition between the two schemes, when the time comes. Which is a fair reason… After all, the Countryside Stewardship scheme (CS) already subsidises farmers who protect the environment, in many a same way that the cancelled scheme would. However, one of the big benefits that were meant to come with the policy was that funding would no-longer be decided by how much land someone was willing to devote to conservation. Instead, funding would be decided on which project would have the biggest environmental impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite the many upsides and downsides, two main debates remain around this part of the policy:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1.     The National Farmers’ Union president has said that it should be private investments that are pushing farmers to carry out conservation projects. The government shouldn’t be subsidising these initiatives when there are “billions of pounds in green finance” ready to invest (Marshall &amp; Prior, 2022).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2.     Whatever the specific wording of the policy, it shows a big shift towards conservation alongside farming and pursuing SDG 13, rather than farming alongside conservation – there were fears that the opposite would happen under PM Liz Truss (Horton &amp; Helm, 2022). Groups like Rewilding Britain have actually praised the government for their efforts to expand wildlife habitats (Rewilding Britain, 2022).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It will have to be put to the test of time as to whether the approach of creating 3 (kind of) new policies will truly benefit farmers in preserving life on land…</p>
