The University of Exeter has green-lit the building of a new Multi-Faith Centre behind the Forum building. Replacing the existing Muslim prayer rooms and multi-faith spaces in the Old Library.

&nbsp;

The new building will be located in the green area behind the Forum Kitchen, and down the steps from the Starbucks outside seating area.

&nbsp;

The University has said that it will pursue building the Centre according to sustainable practices whilst aiming to reduce carbon emissions during the process. The design, construction, and maintenance phases will all be influenced by sustainable practices. The structure itself will be built with Porotherm clay blocks which are made from 30% recycled materials and have an expected lifespan of 150 years; even after which the blocks can be recycled. Extensive insulation, triple glazed windows, air source heat pumps, and solar panels on the roof will also be included.

&nbsp;

The University's 2030 strategy outlines how it wants to use the power of education to promote a sustainable, healthy, and just future. This project reflects the values of respect, community, and inclusion; whilst combatting climate change through sustainable building practices.

&nbsp;

The Multifaith Chaplaincy team already provide a confidential and non-judgemental space for everyone at the university, through several rooms in the Old Library. The team includes faith leaders from Bahaâ€™i, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, as well as a co-ordinator and administrator. Students and staff of the University can receive help with any matters by contacting the Chaplaincy. The new building will create an accessible and convenient place for anyone to access their support.
